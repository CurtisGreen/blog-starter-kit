# Myth versus Fact

There are some statements that cities or elected officials have been making that are incorrect regarding DART and their services, funding, or safety. DATA has complied some of them and debunked every myth. [We need to check the syntax of this paragraph I'm writting this at 2am]: #

## Myth: Transit 2.0 RFP calls for cutting the DART sales tax, leading to inevitable service cuts.
**Fact**: The NCTCOG Transit 2.0 RFP does not call for a cutting in the DART sales tax, it has been stated that   
> “Currently there is no evidence that a lower tax rate at DART is possible. If it is possible, what are the impacts to **service, debt obligations and future service commitments**.” 

Without careful consideration, these cuts could jeopardize critical projects like the Silver Line or the Tier 2 Bus Network.

## Myth: DART's sales tax cut will not impact services significantly.
**Fact**: DART's Chief Communications Officer, Jeamy Molina, has clearly stated that any cut to the DART sales use tax could result in reduced services, staff layoffs, and a significant funding loss of nearly **$6 billion** over the next 20 years.

## Myth: DART is not expanding its services.
**Fact**: DART is actively expanding services, including new suburban bus routes and increased weekend light rail frequencies. These efforts aim to enhance ridership and improve overall transit accessibility.

## Myth: DART's ridership is declining.
**Fact**: While the pandemic caused a temporary decline, DART's ridership has been recovering rapidly. The notion that ridership is continuously declining is misleading; recent trends show significant growth.

## Myth: DART is not addressing cleanliness and security.
**Fact**: DART has upgraded all bus and light rail seats to vinyl for easier cleaning and has enhanced security by hiring additional officers and improving response times. Upgraded CCTV systems further bolster safety measures.

## Myth: DART is not investing in rider amenities.
**Fact**: DART is modernizing its infrastructure with new Next Generation Bus Shelters designed for safety, climate control, adaptability, and enhanced rider experience. These shelters will also feature Real Time Displays for bus arrival information.  (Because we have more room now use the UTA spiel)

**Fact**: DART's FY2025 strategic vision includes assisting 11 transit-oriented development (TOD) projects in multiple cities.

# Bottom Line
DART is proactively addressing customer concerns, expanding services, and improving overall transit quality. Cutting DART's funding would undermine these efforts, despite the clear evidence of progress and growth in ridership. DART's continuous improvements and strategic vision showcase a commitment to enhancing transit for the community, making any funding cuts counterproductive.
