Our latest newsletter highlights key events, including our General Meeting on September 21 and upcoming public meetings at the DART Board and Dallas City Council.

Registration for the Dallas City Council Meeting that we want to attend is now open. Please see some information regarding 

## Dallas City Council Meeting

* Wednesday, August 28, 2024 at 9:00 am
* Dallas City Hall at [1500 Marilla Street, Dallas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BgTdpbSjKRe73pF88)  

We intend to make a big showing here in support of DART funding, and we wish to communicate that we are:

1. ***Opposed*** to DART funding cuts.
2. ***Opposed*** to DART revenue caps.
3. ***Opposed*** to any state legislation that seeks to cap or cut DART’s revenue. The state legislature should *not* be involved in DART’s budget.

This meeting is just one day after the DART board meeting. If you can only attend one meeting, Dallas residents should prioritize this one.

Registration for public comments will close at 5pm on Tuesday, August 27th. If you plan to attend this meeting in-person, please let us know so we can get a count. The City of Dallas also allows speaking virtually as an option in case you cannot attend in-person.

Registration to speak at the City Council meeting will open on Thursday, August 22nd at 8:15 am. There are 3 ways to register:
