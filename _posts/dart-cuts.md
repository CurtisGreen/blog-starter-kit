At the time of writing this, 5 cities have voted for, and 2 cities have voted against a reduction in DART's funding by 25%. Here's how we got here and what's coming next.

## Background
In 2023 some of the member cities of DART, Trinity Metro, and DCTA sent a letter to NCTCOG (North Central Texas Council of Governments) Regional Transportation Council asking for a comprehensive study to *"assess the effectiveness of regional transit today and what regional transit should look like for the next 40 years"*. They asked NCTCOG because they the region's *"neutral transportation planner"*.

NCTCOG released their Request For Proposals (RFP) in late 2023 titled [*"North Central Texas Regional Transit 2.0: Planning for Year 2050"*](https://www.nctcog.org/getmedia/89832cd2-9626-44c8-bb9b-d868febce6f0/RFP-_Regional-Transit-2-0-FINAL.pdf). It writes about wanting to research the best way to make transit more widely available, used by many, and financially sustainable. The way to achieve those would be through:

1. Develop more aggressive transit legislation
2. Increase transit authority membership
3. Improve collaboration between the 3 transit authorities
4. Increase in-fill development
5. Review fare collections
6. Review the current funding system

This all makes sense, it's been several decades and it's important to review the decisions in the past and see if anything should be changed or improved for the future.

But unfortunately, some cities aren't doing that.

## Plano
June 24th - Plano city council met to vote on a resolution supporting cutting DART's funding by 25%. Several citizens voiced their opposition to this but ultimately it passed unanimously. In July Plano [released an article by City Manager Mark Israelson](https://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/617e7bce-3680-45d8-bb90-0351d2241441) with arguments similar to his presentation on the 24th. Towards the end of the article it says *"It is time for Transit 2.0 to arrive*", which is strange considering the Transit 2.0 RFP specifically says *"Currently there is no evidence that a lower tax rate at DART is possible"*.

## NCTCOG Weighs In
June 28th - Michael Morris, the Director of Transportation at NCTCOG, sent an email to all of the city managers within DART. It included some strong and direct language like


> *"we see non-financially supported ideas to support transit revenues used to fund pensions and proposed sales tax reductions"*

and 

> *"local cities claim DART isn’t listening and I’m sure DART would make the same claim"*.

and finally

> *"All 10 cities with highest percentage growth were outside transportation authority boundaries.  If we do not work together and turn this around, roadway funds will be lost to DART cities as well and as the RTC chases congestion, air quality and safety to the rural reaches of the region. This will reinforce even greater inefficient land use."*

The cities reached out, NCTCOG started working on it, and in the meantime the cities do exactly the opposite of the current recommendations. Why ask for help in the first place?

In spite of this firm letter the cities continue on.

## Rowlett
July 2nd - Rowlett's city council put forward a resolution with the exact same wording as Plano's. Plano's presentor seemed more like a politician. They talk about going to the Texas legislature, include facts that support them, exclude things that don't, and use careful wording to makes you think something without them actually saying it. Rowlett on the other hand is a bit more rough. The presentation included numerous errors, perplexing assumptions, and then projections based off of those previous errors that give an even more egregious result. But without the relevant background knowledge the council voted unanimously in support of it anyways.

## Irving
July 11th - Irving city council had DART budget cuts on the agenda. At first it was under the consent agenda, a part of the agenda that is supposed to contain rote items that can be voted on for approval in bulk. Many citizens reached out and asked for them to remove it from the consent agenda so it can have the full discussion it deserves. Irving obliged and many citizens attended the meeting urging them to vote against it. Similar to Plano, Irving council members made vague arguments of fiscal responsibility and examples of DART funding instead paying for police and fire, or lower property taxes. The vote passed unanimously.

## Garland & Richardson
The councils of Garland and Richardson both unanimously voted in support of the current funding levels of DART, a stark difference from their neighbors. Downtown Garland and CityLine in Richardson have been seeing a lot of development effort around their transit centers and it's paying dividends; so maybe it's not too surprising they're against this.

## Carrollton & Farmers Branch
Carrollton and Farmers Branch had their meetings on the same day, with the same result, but the way they went about it couldn't be any different. 

Carrollton's agenda item was titled "Supporting Transit 2.0". It had a lot of formal text talking about what Transit 2.0 is and why they support it, but if you read all the way to the bottom you see a little blurb saying that in support of Transit 2.0 they support a 25% funding cut to DART. Carrollton has a large TOD being built around their Trinity Mills station, it has a connection to the Denton A-Train, and it's getting the new Silver Line station in Downtown Carrolton. They knew that cutting DART at this time of growth would be unpopular, so they hid it under language that sounds positive for transit.

After citizens spoke in protest at the meeting, the council members were confused. What does Transit 2.0 have to do with cutting DART? Why was this titled this way? But ultimately the mayor and city attourney waved away their worries by saying this is just a symbolic vote, it doesn't actually reduce DART funding. So it passed, 6 for, 1 against.

Farmers Branch on the other hand was more hostile towards transit. Several citizens voiced their support for DART and also suggested ride narrowing. The mayor and one of the city council members voiced contempt for DART, transit, and even said *"there's nothing but a chain link fence between them and all the **trash** that comes here on their train"*. Unsurprisingly, it also passed unanimously.

## What's Next
These member cities, led by Plano and Irving, are looking to lobby at the January 2025 Texas legislature to reduce the amount a transit agency can collect from 1% sales tax to 0.75%.

Dallas has mentioned they will vote on this at an upcoming September meeting.
