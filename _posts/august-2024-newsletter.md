Hello there,  

We have three upcoming events that I want you to be aware of this month.  

## August General Meeting

---
First, our August General Meeting will be on August 18, 2024 from 3pm to 5pm at the Metropolitan [1200 Main Street, Dallas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pPBSUsQeJYZr1hxf7) (Enter via Murphy Drive) on the 6th floor, same room as the first meeting we held. We will have light snacks and refreshments available.

We will be discussing our strategy for two upcoming public meetings that we want to show up in large numbers for.

## DART Board Meeting

---

The first meeting is the DART Board meeting at [DART Headquarters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/36uCk3suvRdJPfM47) on August 27, 2024 at 6pm, please arrive 30 minutes early to register for public comments.

Some members of the DART board are not very supportive of transit. Right now, there is a push among some board members to cut DART’s operating budget by 5-10% this year, and cap DART’s revenue growth. Other DART board members have expressed willingness to compromise with these cities that want to cut DART’s funding.

We are here to to communicate 3 things

1. More frequency/service improvements in next year's budget.
2. Our opposition to these draconian budget cut resolutions, and our disappointment with the member cities who passed them
3. Our opposition to ANY revenue capping.
4. Express how DART should oppose any state legislation that cuts/caps their budget

## Dallas City Council Meeting

---
The second meeting is the City of Dallas City Council meeting at [City Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BgTdpbSjKRe73pF88) on August 28, 2024 at 9am. We intend to make a big showing here in support of DART funding, and communicate that we are:

1. ***Opposed*** to DART Cuts
2. ***Opposed*** to DART revenue caps
3. ***Opposed*** to any state legislation that seeks to cap/cut DART’s revenue. We do NOT need to get the state legislature involved in DART’s budget.

This meeting is just one day after the DART board meeting. If you can only attend one meeting, Dallas residents should prioritize this one.

Registration for public comments will close at 5pm on August 27th.If you plan on attending this meeting in-person, please let us know so we can get a count. The City of Dallas also allows speaking virtually as an option in the event you are unable to attend due to other obligations.
