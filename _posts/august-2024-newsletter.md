We have three upcoming events that I want you to be aware of this month.  

## August General Meeting

---
* August 18, 2024 from 3pm to 5pm
* The Metropolitan Condos [1200 Main Street, Dallas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pPBSUsQeJYZr1hxf7) 
* Enter via Murphy Drive

We will be discussing our strategy for two upcoming public meetings that we want to show up in large numbers for.

## DART Board Meeting

---

* August 27, 2024 at 6:00pm
* [DART Headquarters](https://maps.app.goo.gl/36uCk3suvRdJPfM47)
* Please arrive 30 minutes early to register for public comments.

Some members of the DART board are not very supportive of transit. Right now, there is a push among some board members to cut DART’s operating budget by 5-10% this year, and cap DART’s revenue growth. Other DART board members have expressed willingness to compromise with these cities that want to cut DART’s funding.

We are here to to communicate 4 things

1. Our opposition to these draconian budget cut resolutions, and our disappointment with the member cities who passed them
2. More frequency/service improvements in next year's budget.
3. Our opposition to ANY revenue capping.
4. Express how DART should oppose any state legislation that cuts/caps their budget

## Dallas City Council Meeting

---
The second meeting is the City of Dallas City Council meeting
* August 28, 2024 at 9:00 am
* [City Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BgTdpbSjKRe73pF88)  

We intend to make a big showing here in support of DART funding, and communicate that we are:

1. ***Opposed*** to DART Cuts
2. ***Opposed*** to DART revenue caps
3. ***Opposed*** to any state legislation that seeks to cap/cut DART’s revenue. We do NOT need to get the state legislature involved in DART’s budget.

This meeting is just one day after the DART board meeting. If you can only attend one meeting, Dallas residents should prioritize this one.
