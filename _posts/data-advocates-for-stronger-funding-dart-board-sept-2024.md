FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**Dallas Area Transit Alliance Advocates for Stronger Transit Funding at DART Board Meeting**  

DALLAS, TEXAS – On September 24, 2024, the Dallas Area Transit Alliance (DATA) filled the DART Board of Directors meeting with passionate advocates supporting a 5.5% increase in the operating budget for FY2025, as originally proposed by DART staff.

XXX, a resident of XXX and member of DATA, addressed the board: XXX”

XX continued, "XXX"

During the board meeting and committee of the whole, director Flora Hernandez introduced a "compromised" budget with a 4.9% cap on operating growth, which was ultimately approved in a 9 to 4 vote. Hernandez emphasized, "We do not want to leave DART in any way weakened. We're not cutting; we are growing the budget." This budget decision comes amid concerns about service cuts and employee benefits, with several board members voicing opposition to the reduced growth rate.

Tyler, Vice President of DATA, also provided his perspective on the budget outcome: "While I appreciate the desire to move on from belaboring a budget discussion, I think it is pretty clear those 'few million dollars' meant a lot to both the riders and the labor that makes DART actually work. If we had had two more votes against the 4.9% budget, it would have given the 5.5% another shot, and I think we could have won it. I see the 4.9% budget as a far better alternative than the 3% caps that were discussed, but it underscores that we need more pro-DART unity on the board so that this agency can continue to meet the needs of the people it serves."

Alexander Dunn, Secretary of DATA, expressed disappointment with the board's decision to adopt a lower increase. "While unfortunately the board opted to go for a reduced operating budget growth of 4.9%, I am grateful to the DART board members who were resolute in their support of the 5.5% plan, one that was carefully prepared by staff to achieve a balance of fiscal responsibility and DART’s growth needs." he said. "I am disappointed at the corners DART’s board has chosen to cut recklessly in the name of “fiscal responsibility.” I’ll be watching carefully to see what comes of this disinvestment in the agency in the year to come."

DATA thanks the 17 members who signed up to speak at the board meeting and the Committee of the Whole for their commitment to transit advocacy. Their voices are crucial in pushing for necessary funding to sustain and improve public transportation in our region.

"The path forward requires courage and clear judgment," Alexander emphasized. "We must remain vigilant to prevent efforts that threaten the public transit system our community relies on."

DATA will continue to monitor developments and advocate for policies that support robust transit services in the Dallas area.
