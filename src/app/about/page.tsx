        Since forming in 2024, the Dallas Area Transit Alliance (DATA) has become a movement to shine a light on vital issues with public transit in Dallas and the surrounding cities.  DATA has mobilized to address concerns with local officials and representatives, organized with our local communities, and correspond with media to make our voices heard.  We are committed to improving public transit holistically, including advocating for better land use.
